          <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
          <p>
            Culture is not decoration.
            It is infrastructure.
            It shapes identity, power, and memory.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lightgate exists to design and operate
            the systems that allow culture to move,
            scale, and endure.
